# Kaggle-BOT-Detection


About Dataset
The data in question was generated using the Faker library and is not authentic real-world data. In recent years, there have been numerous reports suggesting the presence of bot voting practices that have resulted in manipulated outcomes within data science competitions. As a result of this, the idea for creating a simulated dataset arose. Although this is the first time that this dataset has been created, it is open to feedback and constructive criticism in order to improve its overall quality and significance.

Analysing the data

This is to detect BOT account following on kaggle
The data contains information about account following and its followers. Also contained in the data set is the number post each followers has on its account. Which is the discussion count
